## What is an ADR?

An ADR documents one architecturally significant decision at a point in time, including:

- Context (forces, constraints, and quality attributes at play)
- The decision (the option chosen)
- Consequences (trade-offs: positive and negative)

This concise structure was popularized by Michael Nygard and is widely adopted across the industry. See the originals
and guidance by Nygard and major cloud providers for best practices.

- Google Cloud: [Architecture decision records](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/architecture-decision-records)

## Why use ADRs?

- Improved onboarding: newcomers can understand the rationale behind major choices
- Better alignment: writing ADRs forces explicit trade-off discussion and consensus
- Faster revisits: when revisiting decisions, the context and rejected alternatives are clear
- Preserved context: the code shows “what”; ADRs record “why”

## Lifecycle and governance

Keep ADRs close to code (versioned in the repo), never delete old records; supersede them instead. Typical states:

1. Proposed - drafted and open for review (often via PR)
2. Accepted - agreed and merged; represents current direction
3. Superseded - replaced by a new ADR that links back to this one
4. Rejected - considered but not adopted (kept for history)

## Where to store ADRs

- Use plain Markdown files under version control.
- Common structure: `/adr/` or `/docs/adr/` with numbered files, e.g. `001-use-postgresql.md`.
- Link ADRs from PRs and architecture diagrams/models when relevant.

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/architecture-decision-records) recommends keeping ADRs in the same
repository for visibility and versioning.

## When to write an ADR

Write ADRs for architecturally significant decisions, for example when a choice:

- Impacts system qualities (security, performance, reliability, operability)
- Is costly to reverse later
- Introduces/exchanges key dependencies, protocols, or patterns
- Resolves significant team disagreement

Examples: framework/language selection; database choice; service boundaries and protocols (REST vs gRPC); authN/Z
strategy; deployment model changes; partitioning/tenancy decisions.

See [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/architect-role/architecture-decision-record)
and [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html) for
additional criteria and team workflows.

## Templates you can use

### Nygard's minimal ADR (most common)

```markdown
# ADR [Number]: [Short Title]

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XYZ | Rejected
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Authors: [Name(s)]

## Context

[Forces, constraints, quality attributes, assumptions]

## Decision

[We will …]

## Consequences

- Positive: …
- Negative: …
- Alternatives considered: … (and why rejected)
```

### MADR (Markdown ADR)

MADR emphasizes considered options and decision outcome. See the official site for template and rationale.

- Template and docs: [adr.github.io/madr](https://adr.github.io/madr/)

### Y-Statements (ultra-concise)

Olaf Zimmermann proposes a one-sentence structure capturing context, concern, choice, qualities, and downsides.

```markdown
In the context of [context], facing [concern], we decided for [option] and against [alternatives] to achieve
[qualities], accepting [downsides].
```

## Best practices and pitfalls

- One decision per ADR; keep it short (1-2 pages max)
- Keep ADRs with code; review them like code (PRs)
- Never delete; supersede when changing direction
- Capture real trade-offs; include downsides and risks
- Avoid “any decision record” bloat—focus on architectural significance
- Periodically curate and tag ADRs; link related records

See [InfoQ's guidance](https://www.infoq.com/articles/architectural-decision-record-purpose/) on avoiding dilution and
[Zimmermann's cautions](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2021/04/23/AnyDecisionRecords.html) against turning ADRs into “any
decision records.”

## Example ADR (mini)

```markdown
# ADR 001: Use PostgreSQL for transactional data

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-10-19
- Authors: Team

## Context

We require strong consistency and ACID guarantees for core transactional workflows. Our workload expects medium write
volume, complex queries, and relational integrity. Team skills favor SQL RDBMS.

## Decision

Adopt PostgreSQL as the primary transactional data store for core services.

## Consequences

- Positive: ACID semantics, rich SQL, mature ecosystem and tooling
- Negative: Operational complexity vs embedded/managed KV stores; vertical scaling limits without sharding
- Alternatives considered: MySQL (similar capabilities; team preference for Postgres features), MongoDB (document model
  and eventual consistency misaligned with ACID needs)
```

## Quick-start: add ADRs to your repo

1. Create a folder `/adr/` (or `/docs/adr/`).
2. Add a first record using the Nygard template above.
3. Submit ADRs via PRs; discuss and mark status.
4. When changing direction, add a new ADR that supersedes the old one.

For extensive examples, see Joel Parker Henderson's ADR repository.
