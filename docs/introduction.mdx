The Software Engineering Excellence Handbook is a comprehensive guide that outlines good practices, principles, and
techniques for developing high-quality software. It covers various aspects of software development, including
requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The handbook provides guidance on how to
build software that is secure, reliable, scalable, maintainable, and efficient.

This Handbook does not claim to capture all practices and be fully exhaustive. It does not provide step-by-step
instructions on how to develop a particular software application. Instead, it offers general principles and guidelines
that can be applied to any software development project. The handbook is also not a substitute for experience,
expertise, or good judgment. It is intended to be a reference guide that can help software developers make informed
decisions and improve their skills over time.
